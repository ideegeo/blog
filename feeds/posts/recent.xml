				<title>New in the Marketplace - Bigcommerce, for beautiful online stores</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-05-bigcommerce-main.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bigcommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, e-commerce was the first big draw of the internet. You could go online, pick out things like clothing or electronics, then have the items shipped directly to your house. It was the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first e-commerce sites really weren&amp;#39;t very sophisticated. They were slow, complicated, and pretty walled off from the rest of the internet. Compare that to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce&quot;&gt;Bigcommerce&lt;/a&gt; and...well, there really isn&amp;#39;t any comparison. With Bigcommerce, you get custom websites, secure carts, digital product catalogs, marketing tools, reporting, mobile-optimized shopping, etc., etc. And their online stores can literally be created by business owners who have no coding or design capabilities whatsoever. It&amp;#39;s truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what the web is saying about Bigcommerce:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2014/03/19/why-bigcommerce-says-its-ready-to-take-on-amazon-web-services-to-help-retailers/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Stringfellow says that Bigcommerce’s biggest competitive advantage is that it allows any small retailer to scale from its first sale into the millions. “On average a Bigcommerce client generates nearly twice as much revenue as our nearest competitor,” he underscores. Stringfellow also notes that merchants can choose the look and feel of their store via a marketplace of responsive themes. “We are also consistently optimizing the merchant’s store management interface, the website and all client interfaces to ensure we present the most optimal experience.”&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2727-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-bigcommerce&quot;&gt;Signal v. Noise&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;That desire led to BigCommerce, which is now approaching 10,000 paying customers. According to Harper, the company has grown 480% over the last 4 years and is the fastest growing ecommerce platform in the world. It was ranked the 14th fastest growing software company (#633 overall) on the Inc 5,000 list for 2010 and it now has 50 employees spread between its Sydney, Australia and Austin, Texas offices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/bigcommerce-raises-40m-from-steve-cases-revolution-growth-to-help-smbs-manage-e-commerce/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;As founders Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper explain, for as little as $25 a month merchants can set up a storefront and make their first sale within 48 hours. As ecommerce continues to grow in an Amazon-dominated world, Bigcommerce wants to be the layer for SMBs to operate a various sales channels. So a merchant could sell on Amazon, and eBay but have Bigcommerce be the platform from which they sell these goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bigcommerce is the big equalizer,” Case said of the company. “Now every entrepreneur can have Amazon-like e-commerce capabilities, in hours – not months or years.”&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re serious about creating a world class e-commerce experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigcommerce.com/v18/&quot;&gt;Bigcommerce&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start. At the time of writing, plans start at $29.95/mo ($26.96/mo if paid annually), and there&amp;#39;s a 15-day free trial to see if the platform is right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It takes two to make a thing go right - setting up a website with your domain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we&amp;#39;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html&quot;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; on board, we&amp;#39;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding web hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, you can think of the process a bit like setting up a piece of electronics equipment. The cable needs to be plugged into the machine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; into an electrical outlet. Your domain name needs to be connected to a web platform in our system &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the system of your hosting service platform. When setting up your website, you can do these steps in whatever order you choose. I&amp;#39;ll explain in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All websites need a host, somewhere to &amp;quot;live&amp;quot;. Think of your domain name as the address of your house, and the hosting as the actual house the address refers to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we focus on domains and DNS management, so we don&amp;#39;t offer hosting. However, we want it to be as easy as possible for you to set up hosting with whatever provider you choose. That can be done a couple of different ways, depending on your hosting choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with a service platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-apps.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apps&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up with a service that provides a platform: this includes web hosting &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the software to create and display your website and its contents. Examples of this include Squarespace, Big Cartel, Zenfolio, or Tumblr. In those cases, you have an account with the service, and set up and make changes to your website in that account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those platforms make it incredibly easy to set up great-looking sites with little technical know-how. Click on preferred colours, drag and drop how you want things to look, and you&amp;#39;re all set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you pay just to have an account, sometimes the services are free. Or they can be free for a basic account, and then you pay to scale up the features and flexibility: a &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the services in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;our one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt; are that kind. They provide the hosting and platform for your blog, portfolio, online store, etc. Clicking that green &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; button adds DNS records for your domain in your iwantmyname dashboard. Those DNS records connect your domain name to your account and site with the service platform. That&amp;#39;s half the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verifying your domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some services require you to verify your domain ownership in their system for security purposes. In those cases you&amp;#39;ll likely have to add another DNS record that contains a unique code, which the service checks for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the code from the other service (Squarespace and Google Apps are good examples) and add a CNAME or or TXT record containing the code, then save the new settings. Where we can, we ask you for that code in our one-click setup, and add that extra record for you. The screenshot below shows the one-click setup for Squarespace. (You can see an example of instructions on how to get the verification code &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/guides/domain-mapping-with-iwantmyname&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-squarespace-verification.png&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace verification&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the settings have some time to propagate around the Internet (a few hours is plenty of time, usually), you can verify ownership in your account with the platform service. Often you can do this by just entering your domain name in your account there and clicking a button. These services generally have excellent documentation to explain where and how to complete that. But if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re happy to help, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verification is often the biggest part of setting up your domain with the other service. When verification isn&amp;#39;t needed, it&amp;#39;s often as simple as logging in to your account on that platform, adding your domain name in your account, and saving the new settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where possible, when you finish setting up the DNS records you need in our system, we try to send you to the other site to complete the setup there, too. Once setup is done on both ends and the new settings have time to propagate around the Internet — voila! — you have your new website! (If there&amp;#39;s a snag, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re here to help&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with third-party hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web hosting can also be provided by a third-party hosting service, on which your website&amp;#39;s files reside. Those services generally only provide hosting, and not the software to create your website or email accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;Our recommended hosting partners are Bluehost and Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, which provide only the hosting. Then you can use whatever software and services you like. WordPress is also a popular option, though it provides both the hosting and the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, you connect your domain to the hosting account by adding their nameservers in your iwantmyname dashboard. Using external nameservers is kind of like having your mail forwarded after you move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-nameserver-options.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nameservers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your iwantmyname account dashboard, on the nameserver update page, there&amp;#39;s a drop-down list of many popular hosting providers. Clicking on the one with which you have an account will automatically fill in their nameservers. Then you just have to save the new settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can get the nameservers from your hosting company (or set up your own, if you&amp;#39;re techy) and add them. They often look something like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns1.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns2.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, there is one important thing to remember, which is that you then have to set up any DNS records in your web hosting account, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in your iwantmyname account. Our DNS management dashboard can only work when our nameservers are in place. If there&amp;#39;s any trouble with the DNS records, we can&amp;#39;t access or see them in your hosting account, so you&amp;#39;d need to ask your hosting provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting up your website with a domain name you have registered with us, you will only have to set things up in one of these two ways: either adding DNS records to a service platform, or updating nameservers for an external web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to set up more than one service platform in your iwantmyname account. For example, if you would like to set up a website and email accounts. Or have an online store and a blog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;Feel free to get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions about how to do any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of February, including .work, .delivery, and .yoga</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-02-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;work&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntldstats.com&quot;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;so many options to choose from&lt;/a&gt;—there&amp;#39;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&amp;#39;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Simplecast, podcast hosting made easy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-30-simplecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simplecast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &amp;quot;New in the Marketplace&amp;quot; blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentleman, podcasts are a thing now, and real people are listening to them. What was once a tiny community of hobbyists and public radio hosts is now an industry with hit shows being covered by national publications. But what makes podcasting magic is that there&amp;#39;s virtually nothing stopping you from starting your own show and building an audience—all you need is a half-decent mic, a quiet room, and some simple editing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hangup I&amp;#39;ve seen lately though is hosting. Once you create your show and record some episodes, how do you get them online (and then to podcatchers like iTunes, Stitcher, and Overcast)? Well, if you&amp;#39;re looking for a hassle-free solution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; just might be perfect. With Simplecast, you get unlimited storage and a one-step file importer to build clean sites (using templates or your own design), collaboration tools to facilitate your future team (you know, for when you get big), and easy-to-understand metrics for seeing how you&amp;#39;re doing. It&amp;#39;s all pretty painless, giving you all the energy you need to post your show on a consistent schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-30-simplecast-analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not usually one to read too much into &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecast.fm/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page copy, but the message of simplicity on the Simplecast site really rings true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story behind Simplecast is as simple as the platform itself…we needed it. After publishing multiple podcasts, the same issues kept popping up and we kept saying to ourselves that publishing podcasts had to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting is still pretty young as a platform and we hope to keep building a solid product that makes it easier for all of us. We asked ourselves what we would want in a podcasting platform and it was simple: try it out for free, don&amp;#39;t limit bandwidth, manage everything in one place, get only the stats we need, allow multiple podcasts per account, and have a player that is easy to use and distribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecast.fm&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; has a 14-day free trial, then is $12/mo (or $120/yr). Now I know there are a few free solutions out there for podcast hosting, but you often get what you pay for. Here&amp;#39;s a tweet I often refer to from Merlin Mann (podcast extraordinaire):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just went to listen to a podcast hosted on Soundcloud and it added an extra-extra preroll ad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guys. Hosting&amp;#39;s cheap. Have a little dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/549423128355426304&quot;&gt;December 29, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Webflow, a drag-and-drop site builder for modern websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-29-webflow-moving.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Webflow gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &amp;quot;New in the Marketplace&amp;quot; blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like every website builder has some sort of drag-and-drop feature these days, but the functionality is never quite what you think it will be. There are often limitations, and the dragging and dropping is often limited to template locations and conventional ideas. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/webflow&quot;&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt; though, you really can tinker to your heart’s desire—it’s almost like a modern rethinking of Dreamweaver, but fully hosted and not tied to a Creative Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what others are saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/11/responsive-website-builder-webflow-raises-1-5-million-from-khosla-tim-draper-others/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Today, Webflow lets designers build responsive websites using a drag-and-drop website builder with an intuitive interface in order to customize their site with common web elements, like sliders, maps, buttons, divs, videos, social widgets, and more. On the backend, Webflow generates W3C-compliant HTML5 and CSS3 code. There aren’t many competitors for a service like this, beyond to some extent, Bootstrap, Foundation or Adobe’s Edge Reflow – but those require more a more advanced skill set to use.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/05/designing-responsive-websites-browser-webflow/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Webflow is a tool targeted at designers who are looking for an alternative to Photoshop and Fireworks for responsive web design. It’s not an all-encompassing solution for creating websites — at least not yet — but by enabling me to focus on layout, interaction and content behavior without having to code, it sped up our team’s design phase immensely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2014/05/08/webflow-lets-designers-create-websites-without-learning-to-code/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Webflow’s vision is to do the same thing for web design as tools like Blogger and WordPress did for personal publishing. Those tools completely took down technical barriers (previously you had to be a master of HTML and FTP to get your thoughts online) and opened up the world of publishing to orders of a magnitude of more people, and in the process transformed the web. Similarly, web design currently requires designers to be masters of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the change is inevitable and Webflow plans to lead the charge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-29-webflow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Webflow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a designer who knows what you want, but doesn’t have the time to get your hands too dirty in the dev world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webflow.com&quot;&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt; just might be your next killer tool. Best of all, the platform has a free tier to get started on, and a ton (seriously, a lot) of short &lt;a href=&quot;http://tutorials.webflow.com&quot;&gt;tutorial videos&lt;/a&gt; to help you learn the platform. Give it a go, we think you&amp;#39;ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Muut, a reimagined forum/commenting platform</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-28-muut-acion.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Muut Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the New in the Marketplace blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a blog is quite the endeavor. It’s a commitment to consistent writing, creative thinking, and unending doubt as to whether or not you’re hitting your goals. But one think blog creators often overlook is the means for audiences to have conversations around your work. Too often, the commenting/forum tools used look like they were created in the late 90s, and often function in ways that discourage natural thought processes—and that’s something &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/muut&quot;&gt;Muut&lt;/a&gt; is trying to change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://muut.com/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Muut Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; (I always like a good manifesto):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muut is a radically different discussion platform that can be embedded on any website. It is unencumbered by the weight of unnecessary features and distractions, and places the conversation back to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clean user interface, persistent content and a deep integration to the site will allow a more natural and meaningful discussion to take place, and enable people to focus on topics they care about. It’s a lightweight, super fast, and responsive platform that places minimal strain on data bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re on an important mission. A proper forums and commenting system will increase traffic on any given website, and the audience will stay longer. There is no sane reason not to have forums or commenting on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-28-forum-placement.png&quot; alt=&quot;muut placement options&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Muut is a clean, embeddable, customizable (no iframes), crawlable, responsive, realtime, worry-free conversation platform for your site. And best of all, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://muut.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt; (for an unlimited amount of time, with unlimited bandwidth, users, and data… just a few limited features) for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&amp;#39;s a little something extra if you&amp;#39;re looking to sign up. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3194335-12097132&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and enter promo code MUUT20 by March 1, 2015 to get 20% off.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why does iwantmyname need a monthly newsletter?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&amp;#39;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a challenge. Digital startups today are looking to capture global audiences with smaller staffs, more competition, and leaner margins than the analog brands of yore. For example, here at iwantmyname, our current marketing/communications goal is to reach the entirety of the English-speaking world (and beyond) with 11 people and no giant marketing budget speak of. Basically, we&amp;#39;ve almost exclusively leveraged word-of-mouth to reach customers/visitors in 234 countries (Google Analytics even says we got a visit from N. Korea?)...something we&amp;#39;re extremely proud of, but it&amp;#39;s a constant grind to spread our message of simplicity even further—in a sincere way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sincerity in brand messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m just a naive between-Millennial-and-Gen-Xer (Xennial?), but I often look at advertising as an insincere gesture. When I see display ads, I often think of them as giant billboards trying to subliminally make me like things (I don’t like you, but that cheeseburger looks delicious!). Social marketing is often the same—companies tweet mildly funny tidbits to their followers, hoping for some sort of delightful, friendly response. If their posts were personal notes or direct messages, they’d be charming, but it’s hard to be charmed by a message directed at no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just so much noise. 10 tweets a day from each brand, three Facebook posts, display ads, news articles, sponsorships, appearances. As a consumer, I’m not looking for radio silence, I’m just yearning for a way to turn it off most of the week. I like to see innovation and ideas and compatible company cultures, but I don’t have the time or mental capacity to keep up with fifteen brands shouting at me everywhere I go. None of us do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as an iwantmyname brand ambassador, I feel like the responsible thing to do is to help create a way to deliver our thoughts and innovations without filling people&amp;#39;s lives with even more noise—to compress all the clutter into one manageable chunk. In 2015, I really think this is the best way to follow brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sign up for the monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most days we (along with so many other brands) publish blog posts, then do some connecting social posts—but it would be crazy to expect anyone to pay attention on a daily basis. If you follow the iwantmyname blog daily, as my mom would say, bless your heart. But let’s be honest…if you’re not a keeping up with the industry on a professional or semi-professional basis, you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be thinking about domains all the time. We designed iwantmyname to be the simplest domain registrar on the internet because we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; want people to have to regularly think about our end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have some interesting ideas though, and we regularly highlight features and give suggestions that can make lives easier. For example, if you’re looking to host a podcast, we recently added &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; to our available plugins. It’s a really neat platform—something we think you should know about. And we often post about new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; coming out, which could inspire you to start the next great website. We’re also pretty big on startup culture, so we often write about new tools and thought technologies we find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want some more of the above, or if you just want to know if our brand aligns with your ideals and priorities, the best/least-intrusive option is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, it’s yet another thing  to sign up for, but in a way it sets you free. After you sign up, you can be certain we’ll deliver you our latest thoughts in one easily deletable email (seriously, one click and it’s gone), and after that, you can go back to thinking about whatever it is you should be thinking about—like your job, your family, or your hobby du jour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, for more instant coverage, our social platforms (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;) work great. Our general social strategy is to only spread thoughts—and very few good thoughts can be condensed to 140 characters—so 1-3 times a day we post links to blogs we’ve written, plus the occasional update, and that’s about it. If you see something you find interesting, click on it, but if you don’t, don&amp;#39;t sweat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stats also seem to support a monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine it’s pretty clear by now that I prefer newsletters as the content driver for most brands, but the stats seem to support that thinking as well. If you’ve been an iwantmyname customer for a while, you’ve probably seen the yearly newsletter we send to remind people of our existence (we send it to every customer). Here are some stats from the end-of-2014 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent to 99,960 mailboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29.2% open rate (vs. the 14.7 industry average, according to MailChimp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most clicked items were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the link to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;new monthly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;December domain discounts&lt;/a&gt;, which tells me that a lot of the people interested in domain discounts aren’t regularly visiting our blog or site—which is perfectly understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform&quot;&gt;link to help&lt;/a&gt; with the iwantmyname API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for certain that this is common for newsletters, but the analytics for this particular send seems to support the thinking that our customers would like a monthly edition, and that there are certain topics and tidbits people would like delivered to them on a semi-regular basis. That alone is reason enough to publish a monthly edition, so everything extra is gravy, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TLDR?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need monthly newsletters because people tend to appreciate news and ideas presented in unobtrusive, easily deletable packages. Brands are unique in that they have a ton of combined knowledge to share, but (I’m serious about this) customers shouldn’t have to spend more than 30 minutes a month to keep up with their latest thought technologies. If you want to follow a brand&amp;#39;s blogs and social posts, that’s awesome, but you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you’d like to hear more from us (unobtrusively), be sure to subscribe to our new monthly newsletter, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;iwantmyname:Monthly&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be sending our first edition later on this week, and we think you’ll really like it (and if you don’t, just unsubscribe…&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB5ceAruYrI&quot;&gt;hakuna matata&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startup and tech domain name trends in 2015 and beyond. What’s coming after .IO, .CO, and .ME?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet, .COM was the top choice for companies and their online presences. Then, in the second half of the 2000s, we saw country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; become popular alternatives for tech startups and developers. Now, after the 2014 introduction of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, we’re looking at yet another shift. So which TLDs will take the reigns in the tech/startup world? Let’s take a look at some of the contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-software&quot;&gt;.SOFTWARE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-digital&quot;&gt;.DIGITAL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good options, but with shorter alternatives (e.g. .TECH and .APP) yet to launch, we’ll have to wait and see how they do in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, developers can choose between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-codes&quot;&gt;.CODES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-consulting&quot;&gt;.CONSULTING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-build&quot;&gt;.BUILD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(On a side note, we were surprised to see .CODES being used for personal sites, i.e. yourname.CODES)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain extensions coming soon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tech&quot;&gt;.TECH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cloud&quot;&gt;.CLOUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-data&quot;&gt;.DATA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems&quot;&gt;.SYSTEMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.APP is certainly the 800-pound gorilla here, and we’re expecting it to do really, really well (it’s the TLD with the most pre-orders at iwantmyname).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the TLDs above are technology related (for the article), but if you pull back a bit, there&amp;#39;s a much more important trend at play here—naming diversity. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;more than 200 new gTLDs already available&lt;/a&gt; and many more to come, why would you restrict yourself by following trendy naming patterns, like what happened in the past with .LY (remember these?), or extensions with inexact meanings like .IO, .CO, and .ME? If you’re starting the next Instagram (which launched using the instagr.AM domain hack), wouldn’t it be better to use instagram.PHOTOS or a more generic instagram.APP, for example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the .IO, .ME, and .CO domains initially became popular was that they were empty namespaces with lots of keywords available. However, good names are starting to become rare in these “tech-TLDs”, and that’s exactly why we’re so excited about the new top-level domain alternatives. There are now more naming options than ever, and it will take a while—if ever—until good and affordable names are hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will there be a next .IO, .ME or .CO (which are still great domain extensions by the way)? If anything, we see .APP as the most likely contender, but there&amp;#39;s no set launch date yet. Until then, when choosing a domain, just remember that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/doing-is-almost-always-more-important-than-worrying.html&quot;&gt;doing is almost always more important than worrying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Are your messaging apps/tools secure?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Security is one of those things people tend to shy away from because it&amp;#39;s inconvenient, but keeping things safe is often as easy as using the right service. If you do a lot of online chatting, be sure to check out this secure messaging scorecard from the EFF—it&amp;#39;s an interesting read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard&quot;&gt;From the Electronic Frontier Foundation:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of widespread Internet surveillance, we need a secure and practical means of talking to each other from our phones and computers. Many companies offer “secure messaging” products—but are these systems actually secure? We decided to find out, in the first phase of a new EFF Campaign for Secure &amp;amp; Usable Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scorecard represents only the first phase of the campaign. In later phases, we are planning to offer closer examinations of the usability and security of the tools that score the highest here. As such, the results in the scorecard below should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security; they are merely indications that the projects are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Start naming your brands and domains like a pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Naming and choosing domains often go hand-in-hand, but many don&amp;#39;t take either as seriously as they probably should. To get a glimpse of the professional naming process, take a gander at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-weird-science-of-naming-new-products.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Weird Science of Naming New Products&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Gabler of the New York Times Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to do everything — to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot — he began with “brain,” looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet — 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won’t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad — a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clearly many (if not most) people/brands can&amp;#39;t afford the premium costs of naming firms, but we should all strive to dig a bit deeper into our brands and ideals before coming up with names (if you don&amp;#39;t have at least 100 ideas on paper, you&amp;#39;re probably not trying hard enough). Just another something to add to your 2015 resolutions list. &lt;/p&gt;
