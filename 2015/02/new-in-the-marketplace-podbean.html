<p>Our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services">App Marketplace</a> is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &quot;New in the Marketplace&quot; blog series.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting challenges podcasters face is exposure, and most of the podcast hosting platforms on the market don’t provide much in terms of built-in audiences. <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/podbean">PodBean</a> does, and their built-in podcast marketplace has more than 500,000 independent podcasts covering any category you could ever want. And on top of that, PodBean gives you the tools you need to create customizable websites that can instantly ship shows off to all the biggest podcatchers, with options like unlimited bandwidth and storage, a simple platform for creating premium content, and advertising options via third-party networks for additional monetization. </p>
