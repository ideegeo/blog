#mySugr Interview Questions

1. Thanks for doing this with us! So first, tell me a bit about mySugr and how it's helping to "tame the diabetes monster."
2. Something I've always been interested in is gamification—and mySugr Junior looks like a great (even fun) way to help little ones manage diabetes. What kind of response have you seen from kids and their parents about the app?
3. mySugr is an very international company, with offices in Vienna and San Francisco. What was the though process making the company site a .com, as opposed to another TLD?
4. There are a ton of new TLDs coming out in 2014, one of which is .APP—and thoughts have ranged from "they will never take off" to "the new TLDs are the future." Which camp are you in? Think .APP will take off in the app development world?
5. Reading your blog, it looks like you guys support a number of great organizations. If a reader wanted to help the cause, what are some of the best places to start?
