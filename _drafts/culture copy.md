Team, group, tribe, clan ... hive it is, with our direction as the queen maybe team is good too, kevins point about it is totally valid, maybe it is just me who thinks the term team is over used.

Working in iwantmyname is contributing to our hive, first and foremost. We, as a hive, work based on a shared vision. That shared vision is the collective of all our visions plus direction.

In a traditional company you have a hierarchy and someone who tells you what to do. In a flat loosely coupled hive like ours we have a direction at the center of the hive and a shared vision of what that direction means around it - that shared vision is the sum of us, everyone who is here and our
interpretation of that direction. In order for the hive to go in the direction we agreed on we need to trust that everyone in the hive goes in a direction we can predict. This is extremely important, if someone in the hive acts in an unpredictable manner the whole thing falls apart because we can't rely on that person. 

Flat hierarchy and no fixed rules only works for people who are self-managed enough to deal with that amount of freedom. no hierarchy also means that there is no one telling you by when something needs to be done, this, however breaks down if the trust breaks down and frustration builds up about stuff that is not delivered.

To break out of this we need to get back to a point where we understand the shared vision, what is it that everyone wants out of this, what is it that everyone is willing to contribute and is that, on a hive wide measure, something that everyone is happy with. 

Only if we as a hive know about the shared vision, the directions everyone in the hive is going, then we can manage our own expectations around when things will be delivered and will not be disappointed.

It is important to review that shared vision constantly and make sure we understand each other. only if we know about everyones personal vision we know the shared vision and only then we know where we are heading.

the direction is what we loosely discussed in our yearly planning
session. the shared vision is what we need to talk about way more often
as personal goals shift constantly.

our product is the result of our shared vision applied to our direction,
we want to make the most awesome domain registrar. our customers are the
external feedback loop, they tell us if we fuck up or if we do well. but
the hive, we, we are the most important thing in that whole setup and we
need to know what everyone in the hive is up to, what they want to do
and don't want and how we can together be happy while still going into
the direction we agreed on.

it all comes down to predictable behaviour and the realisation that if
we all work together on something it is so much bigger than if we would
each work on it on our self. 

a big hive develops a dynamic, think of 100 bees flying towards you as a
hive or one after another with some time in between. the later one is
annoying but the first one is fuckin scary. if we are scary, the few of
us can deliver a kick ass product that scares the big guys in the
industry and by extension positions us way above our weight. if we work
solitary we still deliver something but it is way less awesome.

so, how do we get to that shared vision and the understanding what
everyone is up to. how can we make sure we all know what the hive is
doing. for the lack of a better tool i suggest the following alterations
to feedback tuesday:

talk about what you worked on (we do that already) but also talk about
why you did it. ask for feedback on how it went, seek for ways to
improve what you worked on and on the way you did it. if it went really
well, tell that person, positive feedback is important.
goal of this is not to boost your ego (i did bla and am a fuckin hero)
goal is a positive contribution to the hive and in extension to that, to
the product. 

if you see tusday more as a get together, talk to each
other, reflect if what you did helped the hive and made the product
better, then share this. also, share if you struggle with something,
share road blocks you have and share if you just have a rough time
and did not get anything done at all. this is normal but we as a
hive need to know about it and maybe help you getting over that rough time.

another way of looking at this and coming back to the self manage part.
self manage means you have to understand everyone else's vision and
priorities and understand what that means for your own vision and
priorities. in traditional management you have managers that have the
shared vision and apply that to "resources", in our case we have our hours
in a day as "resources" and the manager is everyone of us. if you don't
manage yourself you don't self manage, you float around without a clear
direction. in traditional management you come from the point of view
that intellect is the limiting factor and you try to sort it top down
(that is the underlying idea at least). we don't need to do that, all of
us are smart, we can and want to work on the same level but that means that
we need to self manage.

plan like a manager, look at traditional models but apply them to
yourself, see yourself as the team that you have to manage and then
report back to the c-level meeting we have every tuesday on backlog,
progress and so on. also about problems in your team, that is part of a
c-level meeting. also talk about how you plan to allocate your
resources over the coming week, where those resources will be based
and when ... 

this does not have to be a precise planning but so that the rest of hive
has an idea what to expect.

no laptops or gadgets at meetings

priorities: hive, product

tuesday is about sharing, discussing and feedback.
