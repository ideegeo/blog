Ok, say I design T-shirts and posters for a living, but have no coding skills and little time/energy to learn. Is Big Cartel for me? Do I have what it takes to make a cool store?

So my biggest fear is managing an inventory. Specifically, making sure the products I sell go out the door in a timely manner without getting double-purchased. Help me put my mind at ease.

Clearly in the inventory category, billing seems rather complicated. I want something that takes all the cards, effortlessly applies promo codes/sales and helps me manage all the issues that might come up. Am I asking for too much?

Now for digital goods. With creative stuff being created and distributed digitally, do you have a distribution model for that? Instant shipping, thousands of orders, lots of storage?

I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to get noticed. Will Big Cartel be good for getting my brand on social media? Or more importantly, getting noticed by search engines?

Something is bound to break eventually. What kind of support do you offer?

And before I go, what's Big Cartel going to look like in... let's say 2020. More of the same? Bigger and better? Virtual reality?!?
