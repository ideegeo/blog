#How does the gTLD pre-order process work?

When you pre-order a domain, you are first directed to set up an account on iwantmyname.com (or login to an existing account). To fulfill a pre-order, there are three key things we need, which is why this account is needed:

1. A valid email address - Without an email address, we have no way of informing you of additional gTLD details as they come in, such as launch dates and costs.
2. A valid credit card - To make the purchase of your pre-order on launch day, we need to have a valid credit card on file. 
3. Valid billing info - As a company, we don't want your personal information at all, but the law states that you have to have proper billing information with each domain purchased.

Once you are done with the pre-order, you'll can manage all your domains from the Pre-Order section in your dashboard. And from that page, you can delete your pre-order at any point until the launch date. 

###Pre-launch

At least one week before the launch date, we will send out an email that clearly defines all the important information and next steps to properly secure your domain. This includes:

+ Launch date and time
+ Price
+ What you pre-ordered (in case you forgot)
+ Reminders to ensure your info is correct
+ A brief explanation of the process

###Launch date

Each gTLD will typically launch to the general public one week before the "Go Live" date, but at a very high price ranging between a few hundred to thousands of dollars. Please note that iwantmyname will not take part in this priority launch phase (the registry calls it "Early Access Program"), and only submit pre-orders once the TLD reaches its standard price.

Also:

+ In case there are multiple pre-orders for a domain in our system, we will do an internal lottery first. If your domain is selected, it is your pre-order that gets ordered first.
+ If your pre-order is registered during the priority launch phase as mentioned above, we will not be able to register the domain for you.
+ There could be multiple registrars trying to register the same domain on launch day. Since domains are registered on a first-come, first-served basis, another registrar could register your domain before we do (but we're pretty fast).
