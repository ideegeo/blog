title: gTLDs are awesome, but don't forget about .TO

[Toronto]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-02-04-toronto.jpg)

In addition to the new gTLDs coming out this week, we're happy to announce the availability of .TO on iwantmyname. .TO is the official [ccTLD](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425384-what-is-a-cctld-) of Tonga, but seems to be undergoing a renaissance of sorts. [From Michael Berkens of The Domains:](http://www.thedomains.com/2013/11/04/with-new-gtlds-coming-to-market-to-rebrands-itself-to-represent-toronto/)

>Following on the successful rebranding of .LA which is the ccTLD for Laos for Los Angeles , .TO which is the ccTLD for Tonga send out a press release today announcing the re-launch .TO for Toronto

>“Comparatively  speaking, .TO is wide open”, observed Eric Lyons, of Tonic – the .TO registry operator. “There are thousands of generic keywords and highly brandable names available for registration that are already taken under .COM or .CA”

So, if you're from Tonga or Toronto, or are just looking for a great domain hack/URL shortener, .TO domains are available today.
