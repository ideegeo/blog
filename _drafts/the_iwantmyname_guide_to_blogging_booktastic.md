##4. Managing your expectations

I consider myself a fairly seasoned blogger, with personal and professional blogs going back to the early 2000s. I've had music blogs, tech blogs, movie blogs, food blogs—you name it, I've probably started it. And failed.

See, blog success isn't something you can just chance into. If you take anything away from this guide, it should be that success requires consistency. Whether you're going to publish every day, once a week or maybe just a few times a month, you have to be consistent. 

###Think of your readers

I obviously can't speak for everyone, but I can share with you how I go about finding blogs to read. Let's stick with tech, as that's a pretty popular topic to blog on. 

A solid 75% of the tech sites I read on a daily basis are delivered by aggregators like [Techmeme](http://techmeme.com/). Techmeme highlights all the big news of the day, and tends to feature news and opinions from known sources—the top five in the [leaderboard]
(http://techmeme.com/lb) are TechCrunch, The Verge, Wall Street Journal, Re/code and Ars Technica**These are the primary brands you're competing against as a music blogger, and you'll be competing against established brands in just about any field you want to write about.**


A solid 90% of the music I listen to between 9am and 6pm is on Spotify. And I like Spotify for a number of reasons—I can listen to whatever I want on-demand, it has a free tier and there are quite a few "apps" I can browse through to find new material. Apps like Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and NME—all of which provide seasoned music reviews I can usually trust. 
Opinions may differ on this, but blogging is a bit of a zero-sum game. It's really all about attention spans. Throughout your day, you probably only have the mental capacity to take in a set number of words. Some people read dozens of articles, some people read just a few, but everyone has a limit. 

So to recap, your biggest competition will always be the mega-sites that are pervasive. Music reviews from Rolling Stone, tech news from TechCrunch, sports news from ESPN. Every industry has a big player, and you're probably not going to beat them at their game without a dedicated team and a good amount of funding.
