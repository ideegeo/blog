#Dear Web Platforms, We're Upping Our Affiliate Rate And Making It Easier Than Ever To Buy Custom Domains

We see it all the timeâ€”wonderful web platforms with custom domain abilities trying to explain DNS configs to novice users. 

At iwantmyname, we want to end this madness. We're in an era of site building where users are coming in with no knowledge of the backend web. And for users busy with customizing their sites and navigating the complexities of site marketing, there's just no time to worry about how domain names should work.

And that's ok. Because we've created a platform that can get any domain to any platform with just a couple clicks. 

All we need is for your platform to join us. Using our innovative app marketplace, we're able to create custom landing pages for any platform (here's [an example](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/zenfolio-custom-domain)) that you can link to from your platform's dashboard. From there, your users can buy a domain and set it up in no time. It's practically foolproof. 

And now, for every domain you sell through your platform, you'll receive a 15% commission. That's free money for you, plus a more streamlined custom domain platform setup for your customers. It really doesn't get much better than that. 

So shoot us a message via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iWantMyName) and let's get to work!

And current users of iwantmyname,
