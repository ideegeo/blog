1. Indie Phone. Where to start? So first, tell me a bit about it, and perhaps more importantly, why we need it.

2. Putting privacy concerns aside, there are two main reason (I believe) why most people love their iPhones and Android devices. One is apps. What should customers expect in that department? Will big developers ever brave the waters of an indie OS?

3. Reason two is ease of use. Comfortability. You buy and iPhone, plug-in a few passwords, download a few apps and you're done. But with Indie Phone you get your own server! Are you worried you're going to scare people away?

4. I guess my frame of mind is that to be successful you have to quickly ship millions upon millions of units. But you don't have the Wall St. pressure of an Apple or Googleâ€”Indie's a bootstrapped company with four employees. How much growth does Indie need to have for you to keep it going?

5. Now for a more personal question. Where do domain names fit into all of this?

6. It's 2020. What does Indie Phone and the whole Indie ecosystem look like? Is it a mainstream player or a niche product?

7. And finally, when can I expect Indie Eyewear? I'm desperate for some open-source vision enhancement tools (and who doesn't need a reason to pre-order a .VISION domain?).
