Exposure Questions

1. In a world of content-focused blog platforms and do-it-all everything platforms, Exposure is kind of bucking the trend. What exactly is Exposure?

2. Perhaps more importantly, how does Exposure fit into my online persona? Should I be linking to it from my personal site? Is it my personal site?

3. As far as posts go, how much flexibility do I have? Do I just drop words and photos into the template or do I have to edit layouts and such?

4. So my initial thought after seeing exposure was that it's the true 21st century photo album. But like a good photo album, I want my posts to be able to go anywhere. Is it mobile friendly? Responsive? And is there any way I can get it onto my TV?

5.  Before I get going, I'd like to see it in action. Is there a free trial? And do you have any personal favorite posts you could recommend for inspiration?

6. With iPhones and Android devices taking over, where do you think online photography will be in ten years? Where will Exposure be?
