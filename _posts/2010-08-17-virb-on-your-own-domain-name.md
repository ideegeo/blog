Kudos to the [Virb](http://virb.com) team who have just [relaunched their service](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/16/virb-website-builder/) as a simple website creation tool. Virb allows you to easily make websites for personal use, create an online portfolio, promote your band and more. [Check out if the new Virb is for you](http://team.virb.com/post/944220088).

[We've added Virb](/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain) to our growing [website builder directory](/services/website-builder) meaning that domains can be set up from your iWantMyName dashboard with a single click. Go and [get your custom domain for Virb](/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain) now.
