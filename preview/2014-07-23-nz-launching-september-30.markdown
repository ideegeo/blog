[From anyname.nz:](http://anyname.nz/):

>From 1pm, 30 September 2014, ‘second level’ domains like the .co in ‘.co.nz’ and the .org in ‘.org.nz’ will become optional. You’ll be able to get .nz names with them, without them, or both.

In plain English, the .NZ domain extension will be open to the public on September 30th at 1pm (hooray!). And as with all top-level domain openings, current owners of second-level domains like .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ, etc. will have a safe period (two years) to reserve their corresponding .NZ names.

We'll be sending out more details closer to the launch date, but there is a bevy of information available on [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz/), including the full infographic seen above, additional information about registering your corresponding .NZ domain and a nice introduction video if you're interested.   

And if you have any questions along the way, [don't hesitate to ask](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
