###The popular pair

+ [.CLUB](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) (#1)
+ [.EXPERT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert) (#17)

It was exciting to see [.CLUB overtake .GURU in the top spot](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/this-club-is-quite-popular.html), but the biggest surprise for me was .EXPERT sneaking into the top 20. Being a slightly more direct version of .GURU, .EXPERT seems to be finding its audience, even though it comes with a slightly higher price tag. Will it stay in the top 20 though? Not if new gTLDs like .WIKI have anything to say about it.

###Go local with .KIWI

+ [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi) (#44)

As a New Zealand-based company, it's only natural for us to have a not-so-secret love for the .KIWI TLD. [Back in October](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/a-short-interview-with-tim-johnson-ceo-of-dot-kiwi.html), Tim Johnson, CEO of Dot Kiwi, said of his upcoming TLD was "Underrated and underestimated indeed - that is the definition of the challenger and the underdog. We like that position and thrive on the challenge - I think that is very Kiwi."

And today, just look at it. .KIWI, the tiny TLD from New Zealand, is more popular than .COFFEE, a product served in just about every city in the world. 

###The TLDs for travel

+ [.CRUISES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cruises) (#111)
+ [.FLIGHTS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-flights) (#108)
+ [.VACATIONS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vacations) (#104)
+ [.VILLAS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-villas) (#112)

The last week of May brought a handful of travel TLDs to the mix, and you have to assume at least one of them will rise up fairly quickly. My guess would be that .FLIGHTS and .CRUISES will become the most popular of the bunch because those terms seem like common travel searches, but .VACATIONS could be a sneaky favorite.

###An upcoming favorite

+ [.WIKI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki) (#66)

The future of the web is definitely collaboration, and wikis are perfect for collaborating with your peers to create things. So if I were to pick a future gTLD favorite, I'd definitely choose .WIKI. In its first day it jumped to #66 on the gTLD popularity list, so it seems to be off to a good start. 

###The rest

+ [.DANCE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dance) (#89)
+ [.DEMOCRAT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-democrat) (#98)
+ [.EXPOSED](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-exposed) (#91)
+ [.FOUNDATION](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-foundation) (#86)
+ [.RENTALS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rentals) (#99)
+ [.NINJA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja) (#109)
+ [.WATCH](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-watch) (#82)
+ [.WORKS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-works) (#85)
