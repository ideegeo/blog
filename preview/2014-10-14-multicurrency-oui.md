If you've been on the [iwantmyname website](https://iwantmyname.com/) lately, you might've noticed a change in the bottom right corner of the footerâ€”a multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices in only US dollars, you can switch currencies to NZD, GBP, AUD, and EUR. It's a small feature, but one we're really happy to roll out.

###A Little Backstory

For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. 

But now we're a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we've officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we're really happy with how it's working (being based in New Zealand, it's nice to see things in NZD).

So next time you're looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currenncy: in the footer (see screenshot), on all our price lists (head over to our [homepage](https://iwantmyname.com/) and pick your home currency in the bottom-right of the footer. All prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.
