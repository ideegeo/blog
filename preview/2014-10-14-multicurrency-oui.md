For the first five years of our existance, iwantmyname displayed all prices in one currencyâ€”USD. Dark times, indeed. It was a bit odd for us here in New Zealand, but the fact was that the majority of our business was done in the United States, and implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was too big of a project for our small team to handle. 

But now we're a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we've officially launched our first two alternative currencies, the Euro (EUR) and New Zealand Dollars (NZD) (the Brittish Pound (GBP) will be coming soon). To change your currency, just head to our [homepage](https://iwantmyname.com/) and go down to the bottom-right of the footer.
