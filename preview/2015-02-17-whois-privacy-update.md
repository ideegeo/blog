title: A big WHOIS privacy update

Privacy is rightly a huge concern for many people, and we're actively updating our platform to keep as much of your information off the Internet as we can. On the domain front, one of the easiest ways to keep your identity hidden is to use a WHOIS privacy service, which basically eliminates your domain registration information (name, address, phone number, etc.) from the WHOIS record altogether.

In the past, we've used our own WHOIS privacy service, which masked phone numbers and addresses, but still left names and email addresses in the WHOIS public record. For many, this worked fine, but we've received a number of requests for a more robust solution.

<!-- /excerpt -->

With the new WHOIS privacy in place, all personal information, including names and email addresses, will now be masked. When using WHOIS privacy, you are still the legal owner (registrant) of the domain name, and have full control should you wish to update the registrant details, change the owner, or transfer it to another registrar. But a WHOIS lookup will show none of your personal information.

You can add the service (for free) from the WHOIS update page for your domain(s) under **Domains > yourdomain.com > Domain owner > enable privacy.** Also, if you currently have our old WHOIS privacy service in place, you can update it to the new full masking service. In your dashboard it will show **disable privacy**. Click that to remove the old service, let the page refresh, then click **enable privacy** to add the new WHO privacy service.

Please note that WHOIS privacy is _not_ added to domains automatically. It's optional, so you need to add it in your dashboard.

WHOIS privacy isn't available for all domain extensions (WHOIS privacy availability is determined by the individual registries). Currently, you can use it with the following top-level domains (TLDs):

.ac, .academy, .accountants, .actor, .ae.org, .ag, .agency, .ar.com, .associates, .auction, .band, .bar, .bargains, .bayern, .beer, .bike, .biz, .black, .blue, .boutique, .br.com, .builders, .business, .bz, .cab, .camera, .camp, .cards, .care, .careers, .casa, .cash, .catering, .cc, .cheap, .church, .city, .claims, .cleaning, .clinic, .clothing, .club, .cn.com, .co, .codes, .coffee, .com, .community, .company, .computer, .condos, .construction, .consulting, .contractors, .cooking, .cool, .country, .credit, .dance, .degree, .delivery, .democrat, .dental, .diamonds, .digital, .direct, .directory, .discount, .domains, .education, .email, .energy, .engineer, .engineering, .enterprises, .equipment, .estate, .eu.com, .events, .exchange, .expert, .exposed, .fail, .finance, .financial, .fish, .fishing, .fitness, .flights, .florist, .fm, .forsale, .foundation, .fund, .furniture, .futbol, .gallery, .gb.com, .gifts, .gives, .glass, .graphics, .gratis, .gripe, .guide, .guru, .haus, .holdings, .holiday, .horse, .house, .hu.com, .immo, .immobilien, .industries, .info, .ink, .institute, .insure, .investments, .io, .jpn.com, .kaufen, .kim, .kitchen, .kiwi, .kr.com, .la, .land, .lc, .lease, .life, .lighting, .limo, .loans, .maison, .management, .market, .marketing, .me, .media, .mn, .mobi, .moda, .moe, .mortgage, .nagoya, .name, .net, .network, .ninja, .no.com, .okinawa, .org, .partners, .parts, .photography, .photos, .pictures, .pink, .pizza, .place, .plumbing, .press, .productions, .properties, .pub, .pw, .qc.com, .quebec, .recipes, .red, .rehab, .reisen, .rentals, .report, .republican, .rest, .restaurant, .reviews, .rip, .rocks, .rodeo, .ru.com, .ryukyu, .sa.com, .sarl, .sc, .schule, .se.com, .services, .sh, .shiksha, .shoes, .singles, .so, .social, .software, .solar, .solutions, .soy, .supplies, .supply, .support, .surf, .surgery, .systems, .tax, .technology, .tienda, .tips, .today, .tokyo, .tools, .town, .toys, .training, .tv, .university, .uno, .us.com, .uy.com, .vacations, .vc, .vet, .viajes, .villas, .vision, .vodka, .voyage, .watch, .website, .wiki, .work, .works, .world, .ws, .wtf, .在线, .移动, .中文网, .みんな, .xyz, .yoga, .yokohama, .za.com, .zone

This list is about to grow with the addition of more new generic top-level domains and our knowledge base will be updated with a current [list of domain extensions supporting whois privacy](https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-).

If you have any questions about WHOIS privacy or your current setup, definitely [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
