title: "A story about Apple, and a plea for more bold companies and progressive ideas"

<!-- excerpt -->

I was away from the news for much of last week (I tried my best to avoid it while [in Bali](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/11/bali-trip.html)), but I did catch one big bit tucked away in an English-language newspaper on the [Hong Kong Airport Express](http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/transport/to-from-airport/airport-express.html)—word of Tim Cook (the CEO of Apple) writing, as Kara Swisher put it, "perhaps the most [epic coming-out essay](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay) I have ever seen." 

It may seem insignificant to some, but these are the acts of braveness the world needs from its leaders. Messages that change lives. Inspire people to be great, and do great things. But we could all be doing so much more.

Just for reference, here's how the Hong Kong Airport Express works. If you have a long enough layover in Hong Kong, you can rush over to a train that can get you all the way to the central city (Hong Kong Station) in 24 minutes. The terminal is built into a mega-mall called the IFC, which basically houses every luxury brand you've ever heard of. And of course, after walking around for a few minutes I found myself staring at a giant Apple Store (complete with the cool translucent staircases you find at the various flagship stores). It wasn't open yet, but I know how the symphony goes. The doors open, a swarm of blue shirts stream out to preach the brand, and countless people walk out with their first, second, or fiftieth Apple product.

As an Apple fan and occasional stockholder, I marvel at what Apple has created with their retail spaces. They're beautiful, and most of the time, the employees buzzing around perfectly fit the brand. But, as the lowest level employees in the company, how important are they in the grand scheme?

Under their current structure, Tim Cook values himself as roughly 2,568x more important than the base Apple retail specialists making these initial transactions ([$28,810](http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Apple-Apple-Retail-Specialist-Hourly-Pay-E1138_D_KO6,29.htm) vs. [$74 million](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/04/apples-tim-cook-banked-74m-in-2013-topping-all-but-one-sp-500-tech-ceo)...that includes CEO stock options). I suppose staggering wage gaps are fairly common these days (more than ever, by many accounts), but doesn't it seem insane?

[From Apple Insider:](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/21/apple-inc-surprises-with-massive-17-billion-q4-stock-buyback)

>Apple's chief executive Tim Cook almost casually noted during the company's earnings call this week that Apple had spent another $17 billion on stock buybacks in the September quarter, over three times as much as it spent in either the previous June quarter or its year-ago September quarter. 
>
>"Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's future, while retaining — while returning cash to our shareholders," Cook stated. "We had executed aggressively against our share repurchase program, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone and $45 billion in the last year."

According to Wikipedia, Apple currently has 98,000 employees. If they, instead of buying back $45 billion in stock to please investors, redistributed that money to the people who helped build and sell their brand, each employee would've received $473,684. That's absolutely life-changing, while the stock buyback just made a number of investors a smidge more money.

I'm not going to pretend to be an economist, and maybe manipulating the market is more valuable to the global economy than directly changing the lives of nearly 100,000 people, but I desperately want to see companies of all sizes do more for their people (and communities...think of all the world-class museums and public spaces Apple could've built!). In the past we've talked about our [one-salary experiment](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html), and while our scheme certainly wouldn't translate to a giant corporation (or even a large one), after personally living it for a year now, I've found myself getting more and more disheartened when I see friends and family getting crushed by the weight of...honestly, greed and carelessness.

I'm only picking on Apple here because they're in a unique position, with a progressive enough CEO, to truly "think different." But truthfully, there are so many companies (and so many CEO's making unthinkable wages) out there that could be using their staggering profits to do so much good in this world. I just hope more people take up the torch and do so.
