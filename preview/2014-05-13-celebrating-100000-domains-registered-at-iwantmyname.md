A few months after our [5th birthday](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html) we are proud to announce that we crossed a major milestone: 100,000 domains managed by iwantmyname!

That's still tiny compared to the big players in the industry, but we've proven our idea that there's room for a domain registrar doing things a bit differently. Our mission from the start is focussing on simple and straightforward domain management and getting out of our customers' way so that they can quickly set up their own web address. Simple and honest [domain pricing](), [no annoying upselling](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html) and a focus on [great customer service](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname) helped us to get were we are today.

From a company perspective, we are also thrilled to have achieved this as a bootstrapped startup from a remote corner of the world (in case you didn't know, we are based in Wellington, New Zealand). However, we very much see ourselves as an international company which is reflected in the fact that 90% of iwantmyname customers are from overseas.

And that brings me to the people who made all this possible: our customers. It is inspiring to see your ideas coming to life--the countless Tumblr sites making us laugh, blogs we're reading every day, developers creating great apps, shops selling people awesome t-shirts or designers blowing the interwebs away with their artwork. You are the reason why we get up every morning (or stay up late). Thank you so much!

**A few interesting facts and tidbits from behind the scenes:**

- The oldest domain currently under management was registered almost 24 years ago!
- We processed over 200,000 registrations, renewals and transfers over the last 5.5 years
- It took us one year to get to 1,000 domains under management and 4.5 years for the remaining 99,000
- We now offer [212 different domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) and are adding more on a weekly basis
- Your domains are being looked after by [9 people](https://iwantmyname.com/about) (4 developers, 2 support, 1 product, 1 operations, 1 content)
- 10 cents from each domain registered [goes to global aid initiatives](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html)

**What's coming next?**

It's simple. We will continue with [our mission](https://iwantmyname.com/about):

> We believe that any person, organisation or company should have complete control over their web address. You should be able to own it, use it the way you want and move it if necessary. This can all be achieved by registering a domain name. 

There are hundreds of [new generic top-level domains] (https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) being released over the next few years. We will do our best to make it even easier to [find, own and manage your web address](https://iwantmyname.com).
