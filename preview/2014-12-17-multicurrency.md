If you've been on the [iwantmyname website](https://iwantmyname.com/) lately, you might've noticed a change in the bottom right corner of the footer—a multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices in only US dollars, you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollars, GBP, AUD, and EUR (. It's a small feature, but one we're really happy to roll out.

###A Little Backstory

For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. 

But now we're a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we've officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we're really happy with how it's working (being based in New Zealand, it's nice to see things in NZD).

So next time you're looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot), on all our price lists (like [this one](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions)), and in your account payment settings. All prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.
