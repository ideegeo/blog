If you're interested in domain names or like to follow the domain registration industry, it's good to take a step back every once in a while to look at the new gTLD (generic top-level domain) trends that are emerging. iwantmyname's business model really doesn't benefit from the popularity of one domain extension over another, but for us, this is perhaps the most exciting namespace expansion we'll ever see. I mean, there's a real chance that decades from now we'll all look back at the early days of the internet and laugh about how everything ended in .com. We're still at the beginning of this whole "internet naming thing," but the scaffolding for the future is being constructed before our very eyes. Here are some of the trends we're noticing today.

##City TLDs are definitely going to be popular

We've [talked about this](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/08/hyperlocalize-with-a-city-tld.html) a bunch in the past, but of the five city TLDs launched so far (.berlin, .hamburg, .nagoya, .tokyo, .wien), three are in the top 25 of domains registered:

 + .berlin at #2
 + .tokyo at #17
 + .hamburg at #24

 And one, [.london](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london), is already at #18, even though it won't be available for general registration until September 9th. 

##Non-Latin TLDs are picking up steam

One of the more exciting trends in this new expansion is the launch of TLDs that don't use Latin characters. In the future we'll have domains in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, and the internet will be better for it. The currently launched non-Latin gTLDs vary in popularity, but four are currently in the top 25:

+ .公司 at #8
+ .在线 at #10
+ .网络 at #12
+ .中文网 at #22. 

##General business TLDs are making a push

Business TLDs as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but some of the more internet-native/savvy general business TLDs seem to be doing quite well. In the top 25, we have: 

+ .link at #4
+ .photography at #7
+ .email at #9
+ .company at #14
+ .solutions at #15
+ .center at #16
+ .technology at #20
+ .directory at #21

##Retail and physical business TLDs are not

While TLDs for companies that primarily live on the web are doing fairly well, traditionally brick-and-mortar businesses don't seem as ready to migrate from .com. Extensions like .clothing and .bike are the top pair, but neither have more that 13,000 registrations. And promising TLDs like .equipment, .coffee, .tattoo, .boutique, .plumbing and .shoes have yet to crack the 10,000 registration barrier. That's not to say that they won't eventually be successful, but it seems like small businesses with physical locations are hesitant to make the change.

##"Discount TLDs" aren't doing well at all

One of the more surprising trends is that the TLDs related to the deals industry aren't doing well at all. The top of the pack, .cheap, only has 3,281 domains registered, sitting just out of the top 100 at #105. And .blackfriday, the deals TLD for the day after Thanksgiving in the US? Only 657 total registrations.

This is only a guess, but deal sites tend to struggle with legitimacy, and being an outlier in an industry with a lot of perceived fraud probably isn't a compelling business plan. Once the world deems these new gTLDs normal, I'm guessing the "discount TLDs" will start moving over to get out of the crowded .com namespace.
