<!-- excerpt -->

Let's face it, I, like many of my colleagues, have a bit of a problem. I think of the web as a blank canvas, just waiting for my ideas to populate its empty space. And every time I have a new idea, I do one thing—scramble to grab the corresponding domain name. 

My ongoing quest has gotten a bit easier since the launch of the [new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (being able to get just about any name in some form is a huge time-saver), but the underlying problem still remains. For a year at a time I'm sitting on a pile of empty dreams and untapped potential. 

But think of the process it takes to create a new site. You have to design it, come up with a consistent content strategy, create a bunch of social accounts and mailing lists, then promote the hell out of it. It's exhausting! 

The proposed solution? From Brian Knapp, in an article titled, [Everything On One Domain](http://retromocha.com/learn/put-everything-on-one-domain/):

>There is so much more value in having everything on this website than there is in having even two or three different domains we are managing. From an SEO perspective, every time we promote our website we get links and attention that helps promote our other products. From an email marketing perspective, we are building a single mailing list that we can promote anything on.

>For our limited resources, it makes so much more sense to have one great website instead of multiple mediocre websites.

So I firmly agree with the one-site-all-product mentality for a lot of things (most of my ideas certainly don't need full sites), but I don' think it's the one-size-fits-all solution the author suggests. Yes, using one domain for everything in the brand "worked pretty well for Apple" (although one could argue that Beats and FileMaker break the narrative), but would it have been good for an early Gawker , or your local restaurant group to roll up its various entities?

For one, when you pile everything into one domain, you're severely limiting your branding options. Instead of giving every new project its own personality, you're all but forced to roll everything into your overarching aesthetic. That's fine for a brand like Apple, but what happens when your ideas jump from music production to digital photography to urban farming? Might you want separate concepts then?

And, by putting all your ideas on one domain, are you limiting each idea's potential success? Would Twitter be Twitter if, in 2006, it shared a page with Odeo?

But alas, like most things, it all depends on what you're looking to accomplish. If you're finding yourself piling up domains to tickle your every fancy, it may be wise to take the advice of Brian Knapp. For me, my personal brand would be infinitely stronger if I'd just consolidated my random work over the years. 

Don't be afraid to break out though. As I said before, the new gTLDs make it easier than ever to find great domain names ([straying from .com is A-ok](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html) in my opinion), and in the scheme of things, the costs associated are fairly minimal. Just know that with every new site/project you create, you're either stretching your capabilities or neglecting something old—and very few good things in life come from divided focus.
