title: How to drop the .co from your .co.nz domain today

The shorter .nz domains have arrived! Now you can purchase New Zealand’s country-code domain extension without the additional ‘.co’, ‘.net’ or ‘.org’. This naming convention is already common in most countries, and we’re pleased to now be able to offer this option to iwantmyname customers.

##How do I make the switch?

If you have an existing .co.nz, .net.nz or .org.nz third-level domain name and are looking to grab your corresponding .nz domain name (it's not mandatory, but people are likely going to gravitate to the shorter option), you need to find out what your domain's status is.

First, check the status of your domain name at [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz). If you have preferential rights, you'll have reservation rights on the .nz domain until March 31, 2015, and can register the mathing domain with any registrar (or [keep it from being reserved by anyone else for 2 years](http://anyname.nz/reservation-process.html)). Existing domains managed at iwantmyname or another registrar can be converted using our regular domain transfer option. Simply get the transfer authorisation code—also called UDAI—from the iwantmyname dashboard or your current registrar (if the domain is not managed with us) and [start your transfer](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer).

If you don't have preferential rights, your name may be conflicted, meaning at least two second levels are registered (e.g. you hold yourname.co.nz and others hold yourname.org.nz and yourname.school.nz). To resolve this, you can use anyname.nz’s online tool to [lodge your preference](http://anyname.nz/conflicted-names.html) as to who should get the domain.

The third option is that if you registered your .co.nz domain name after 9am, 30 May 2012, your [.nz domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. 

##How can I get my website to work with the shorter .nz domain?

Once you've registered ‘yourname.nz’, the easiest way to start is to simply forward it to your existing ‘yourname.co.nz’ domain name. You can do this using the “Web Forwarding” option in your iwantmyname dashboard.

If you just want to be done with your .co.nz domain altogether though, be sure to read Google's [instructions for transferring, moving, or migrating your site to a new domain](https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/6029673?hl=en&ref_topic=6001951). The act of changing your domain over is simple, but you can lose your search engine ranking if the trasition isn't planned carefully.

And if you are starting a website or project from scratch, we'd definitely recommend using ‘yoursite.nz’ instead of ‘yoursite.co.nz’ from the beginning. It'll save you the hassle of switching later on.

##Send us any and all questions

This transition is a major one for New Zealand, and we want to make sure it's a painless as possible. So if you have any questions about your .co.nz domain, or just the new .nz domain names in general, please [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
