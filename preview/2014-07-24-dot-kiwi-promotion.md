<!-- excerpt -->

Of the [100+](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) we've launched this year, none represent our little corner of the Earth (we're based in New Zealand) better than [.kiwi](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi).

And now, to promote the quirkiest little domain extension on the web, we're excited to announce [a contest](http://www.promotion.kiwi/truecolours/), brought to you by our friends at Dot Kiwi.

<!-- /excerpt -->

## The contest

From now until 6 August 2014 (11:59 PM NZST), every .kiwi domain you register at iwantmyname counts as an entry to win a $1,000 NZD prize from [Dot Kiwi](https://hello.kiwi/) ([terms and conditions](http://promotion.kiwi/terms/)). 

So if you're a New Zealander, or just love the .kiwi domain, and are planning to start a website or blog in the foreseeable future, now's the time to grab your domainâ€”because nothing (seriously, nothing) is better than winning money for obtaining something you'll actually use.
 

## And to make it better, a .kiwi sale

To make the contest even more appealing, we're dropping the price of .kiwi from $35.90/yr to XXXXXX. It's the least we can do to spread the love of New Zealand's most unique TLD.
