Our US customers might have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, but local websites in much of the world end with something like this—.CO.NZ. But the days of ".CO" littering otherwise clean domains seems to be coming to an end. The United Kingdom recently opened up their [.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) second-level domains, and New Zealand is now following suit.

Starting 30 September at 1pm NZDT, .NZ will be available to everyone on a first come, first served basis ([pre-registration](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) is still open!). But current owners of .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ and .NET.NZ websites will have the ability to reserve their corresponding .NZ domain names for a limited time. Here are the rules.

<!-- /excerpt -->

##How to get your corresponding .NZ domain name

Your first step is to [check your "right of registration status,"](http://anyname.nz/index.html) which can be one of the following:

+ Preferential Registration or Reservation (PRR)
+ Conflicted

With your "right of registration status" known, there are three key eligibility dates to remember, with specific instructions included:

###Group 1: Domains registered before 9am on 30 May 2012

If your .CO.NZ domain has ‘Preferential Registration or Reservation’ (PRR) status and is the only instance (there are no identical .NET.NZ or .ORG.NZ names registered), you are entitled to register or reserve the shorter version. Owners of conflicted names need to agree with everyone about who will get the shorter version. 

###Group 2: Domains registered between 9am on 30 May 2012 and 3pm, 11 February 2014

If your .CO.NZ domain has ‘Preferential Registration or Reservation’ (PRR) status and is the only instance  (there are no identical .NET.NZ or .ORG.NZ names registered), you are entitled to register or reserve the shorter version. Conflicted names registered in this timeframe will be available on a first-come, first-served basis on 30 September 2014 at 1pm (NZDT).

###Group 3: domains registered between 3pm, 11 February 2014 and 1pm, 30 September 2014

No PRR or conflicted names are eligible for pre-registration, meaning the shorter .NZ version of the name will be available for general registration (first-come, first-served) on 30 September 2014 at 1pm (NZDT).

***

Optionally, you can reserve your corresponding domain for up to two years without purchasing it through [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz/) (not affiliated with iwantmyname). You must do this before 30 March 2015 though, so if this is the path you want to take, don't let it slip by.

This is a big deal for the world of New Zealand websites, so if you have any questions about the launch or your specific domain's status, please [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
